\section{Lecture 12: Low Power Architecture}
For some applications, low power consumption is more important than performance:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mobile communication and computing
\item Wirteless internet
\item Medical implants
\item Deep space applications 
\end{itemize}

This will lead to longer battery life and to keep costs down, in terms of power consumptions. It will also lead to a longer life due to lower temperature, as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:thermal-reliability}.
